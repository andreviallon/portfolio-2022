				So, this is where I get to talk a bit about myself. My name is André. I'm a Frontend
				Engineer with a great passion for creating beautiful, modern and intuitive User Interfaces.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-2">
				I've always wanted to push myself and learn more. That's why I left France, my home country,
				to move to Denmark back in 2012 where I joined the International Baccalaureate in
				Sønderborg. I then went on with studying Web Development as well as UI design at the
				International Business Academy in Kolding.
			</p>

			<p class="pb-2">
				In my spare time I enjoy, playing the guitar, reading books, cinema or various sports such
				as running, going on hikes, biking or doing yoga.
			</p>

			<p class="pb-2">
				I encourage you to checkout my resume to learn more about my past experiences and my skills.
